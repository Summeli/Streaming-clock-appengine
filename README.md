streaming-clock
============================

Streaming clock for finice ice climbing competitions
Written with / for Google appengine

This was once used in finice2020. Rewite into node & react to be made in 2020.

## The protocol
This project uses websockets to start / stop timer  

### Lead Climbing (will be used in finice2020)
In lead climbing there is only one climber on the route, so we should have separete controls for two different clocks    

reset clock to x minutes    
`rcrx` or `rclx`

start clock     
`scr` or `scl`

pause clock    
`pcrxxx` or `pclxxx` where xxxx is time in seconds
  
### Speed  (was used in finice2019)
reset clock to 0 and start it   
`srs`  
  
false start right / left  
`srf` or `slf`  
  
update bib-number right / left clock  
`sbrxxxxxx` or `sblxxxxxx` where xxx is the bib number    
  
stop right / left clock  
`ssrxxxxbyyy` or `sslxxxxbyyy` where xxxx is time in milliseconds and yyy is the bib number

## Updating to latest Artifacts

An easy way to keep your projects up to date is to use the maven [Versions plugin][versions-plugin].

    mvn versions:display-plugin-updates
    mvn versions:display-dependency-updates
    mvn versions:use-latest-versions

Our usual process is to test, update the versions, then test again before committing back.
